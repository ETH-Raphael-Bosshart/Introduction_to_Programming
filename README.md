# Netflix User Data Analyser
## Skills: Programming - Introduction Level HSG

Have you ever thought about how much time you spent on Netflix or how many movies and series you watched until now? 

That's exactly the purpose of this little project! The user is able to visualize the amount of time used and moreover also on which devices! As a little extra, the code also shows a graph of the amount of money spent.

### Description

An in-depth description of our code can be directly found in the code itself.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
The following libraries are used in our code and therefore needed before running it:
* pandas
* matplotlib
* numpy

If you're new to Python, it is most likely that some of the used libraries are not yet installed on your device. 
To make sure that you can run the code successfully, please install these libraries. Therefore run the following commands in your terminal seperately:
```
  pip install pandas
```
```
  pip install matplotlib
```
```
  pip install numpy
```
Prior running the code, you also have to download your user data from the Netflix website:
```
https://www.netflix.com/account/getmyinfo
```
After clicking on the link, you'll see a button: "Submit Request". After clicking on it, you are going to receive a link to verify the request. Some time later you are able to download the data directly from link above. Make sure you do this prior running the code and to save the file on your device.

### Executing the program

To run the code successfully, follow the step-by-step instructions:

* Download any IDE working with Python. In this example here, we'll work with Visual Studio 2022
* Open up a new Project by:
    * New File...
    * Python File
* Copy our code (Netflix.py) and paste it in your just created Python File
* To make sure that your Netflix files are found, please open them in your IDE by:
    * File
    * Open Folder
    * Click on the folder called "CONTENT_INTERACTION" in "netflix-report"
    * In addition, also open the folder called "PAYMENT_AND_BILLING" in "netflix-report"
 * Click on "Run Python File"
